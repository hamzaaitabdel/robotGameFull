A C++ project for the university, made by Ait Abdelouahab Hamza and Salah El Mesbahi.

This project is about simulating a differential robot in a 2d plain, with avoidance of some obstacles.

The interface is as a game, so first there is a menu shoing two options:

* Manual

for the manual, the user can use hes arrow keys to move the robot.

* Automatic

for the automatic, the user doesn't do much, but the probram runs an algorithm to try to avoid obstacles so that the robot can arrive successfully at the wanted goal
